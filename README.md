# Flutter Exporation

This project is a collection of tutorials and cookbook examples mostly re-created from the official Flutter documentation for the purpose of learning. 

## Study Rules!

* All code must be manually typed without copy/pasting from existing examples
* Experiment to any degree with all examples to expand understanding


## Boilerplate from `flutter create` ..

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
